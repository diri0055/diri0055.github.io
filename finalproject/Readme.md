I don’t have professional photos that I can show, so I used Unsplash photos. It is college approved site.

When you don’t have your own work to show, it is tough to create portfolio. Also, I do not know the industry very well, so I can’t talk about it in great detail.

I will take more photos for free, so I can create my own portfolio in the near future.

I build this website using Bootstrap. I like Bootstrap. It makes everything simple. 

All the images are Unsplash photos, and it is Algonquin College approved site.
